### Objective
This project requires you to explore given data set, design interactive dashboard, and then convey your results in a website through Google Sites.

### Instructions
There are two milestones in the project.

### Creating Dashboard - First Milestone
Import the dataset using Web Data Connector. Go to Connect > To a Server > Web Data Connector and paste https://tableau.data.world/?dataset_name=covid-19-data-resource-hub%2Fcovid-19-case-counts&query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20covid_19_activity%20WHERE%20report_date%20BETWEEN%20%272022-01-01%27%20AND%20%272022-06-30%27&queryType=SQL in the box.
☝Important: The full dataset is a large one and may need extra computing time when creating views in Tableau depending on your computer's hardware spesifications. Therefore, we only select a certain part of the data.
Create an interactive dashboard.
### Creating a Google Site - Second Milestone
Create a Google site. Choose a meaningful site name that reflects your site's purpose. Please refer to the following link on how to create a google site: https://support.google.com/sites/answer/98081?hl=en
